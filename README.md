I have created a task in Task Scheduler with triggers for different times when a program should be running. The program distributes medicines to patients, the information of which can be found in a table in a SQL database. The program checks if there are any pills left and, if yes, dispenses the medication according to the specified dose for each patient. The program then updates the number of pills left by subtracting the number of dispensed pills from the total number of pills.
